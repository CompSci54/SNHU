1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? 

The goal of the app that I developed is to provide a tool that will allow users to keep an inventory of the items they wish to track. 


2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

It is necessary that the app has a screen to add, edit, and delete inventory items. This was accomplished by having the home screen as the center of the app functionality with the inventory list on the home screen and buttons that opened activities to edit or add items. The home screen also provides easy access to delete items or enable SMS notifications when the inventory is low.


3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The approach I used is what I use for most large tasks, I access the scope of the task, then I use the "eat an elephant one bit at a time" approach by breaking the task into small pieces. This approach has worked for me in the past and can be applied in the future to many other tasks.


4. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested my code by first evaluating the requirements for the app then I created a manual test suite to verify that I have met all the requirements. I then reviewed the code and thought of edge cases that may cause an issue. Thereafter, I executed manual tests to ensure there were not any edge cases that caused an issue.


5. Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

When creating the Inventory app, a challenge I has was displaying the inventory items that are in the database in a grid that accurate and intuitive to the user. I did this by creating a template xml activity that was used as a row that would be added to the home screen when a new item was added to the inventory. 


6. In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Specifically creating a database helper class that was used to create the database and tables that are used to store data and methods to create, read, update, and delete items and user accounts in the database demonstrates my knowledge, skills, and experience.
