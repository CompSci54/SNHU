How do I approach designing software? 
I start with fulling understanding and writing down the requirements. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project helped me develop skills in 3D modeling.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I began by reviewing the assignment requirements, planning each object with basic shapes, assembling them into the scene, then focusing on textures and fine-tuning the lighting. After I thought the project was complete, I review each requirement again to ensure all requirements were met.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Breaking down complex designs into smaller, manageable components can be a valuable tactic for future projects.

How do I approach developing programs?
I typically start with a clear roadmap, break down each task into steps, and test as I go along to make sure each part functions correctly, then review the requirements again.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I really did not use anything different than I have used in the past. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
I continuously tested and refined the scene, adjusting textures, lighting, and camera angles with each iteration until reaching the final result.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
I do not think this project has changed my approach to development, but it did teach me about 3D rendering. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science gives me the tools I need to build, problem-solve, and create things that are useful in pretty much any tech-driven field. Right now, I’m working in engineering for a medical device company, where computer science plays a big role in everything we do. My ultimate goal is to start and run my own businesses, and I believe computer science will be key to getting there—whether that’s by building systems that make things run smoother or by launching a SaaS company.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
They offer practical experience with programming, math, and design, which will be valuable for any advanced studies.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
These skills create pathways into fields like game design, animation, and industries that rely on visual simulations and creative design solutions if I wanted to take that path.
